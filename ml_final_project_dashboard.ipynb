    "### SHAP Analysis Commentary – Insurance Premium Prediction - HistGradientBoosting\n",
    "\n",
    "This SHAP summary plot explains the impact of each feature on insurance premium predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `age`\n",
    "- Higher `age` values (pink dots on far right side of vertical 0 line) significantly increase predicted premiums.\n",
    "- Lower `age` values (blue dots on the far left side of vertical 0 line) decrease premiums.\n",
    "- Clear positive correlation: **older individuals → higher insurance costs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `any_transplants`\n",
    "- Having undergone a transplant leads to a strong increase in predicted premiums (pink dots on far right).\n",
    "- Those without (blue values - low feature value were not on extremes) have minimal or even negative influence on premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `any_chronic_diseases`\n",
    "- Individuals with chronic conditions (pink dots on right side of vertical 0 line) show increase in premiums.\n",
    "- Those without (blue values - low feature value were not on extremes) have minimal or even negative influence on premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `number_of_major_surgeries`\n",
    "- More major surgeries tend to increase premiums slightly, but the effect is less consistent since low (blue) and high values (pink) overlap around 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. `blood_pressure_problems`\n",
    "- Least influential among the top 5 features.\n",
    "- High blood pressure (small pink - High Value dots on little right of vertical 0 lines) contributes marginally to higher premiums. The blue and pink dots overlapping around 0 indicate little to no effect on prediction \n",
